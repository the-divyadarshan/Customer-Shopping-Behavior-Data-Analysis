# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Data-Analysis
This project is an end-to-end data analytics workflow designed to analyze customer shopping behavior, purchase trends, and review patterns. It includes loading and exploring a dataset in Python, performing data cleaning, running SQL queries in MySQL/SQL Server, and building an interactive dashboard in Power BI. A final report and presentation (created using Gamma) summarize the key insights and business recommendations.
